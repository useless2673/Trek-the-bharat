**Trek the Bharat 🌏**
This project was developed as a full-stack web application in collaboration with a peer during my second year of engineering. I primarily contributed to the front-end development and UI design, exploring and implementing new technologies such as Bootstrap, Boxicons, CSS, and JavaScript tools.

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with modern web technologies and helped strengthen my understanding of responsive design, clean layouts, and user-friendly interfaces — skills that are now part of my development toolkit.
